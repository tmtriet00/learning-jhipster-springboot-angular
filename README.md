# Task 1
- [x] Make sure to use only 1 JDL file to generate Employee and Gateway service
- [x] Make sure using Spring Boot as backend code

- [x] Make sure using Angular as frontend code

- [x] Make sure Employee Entities description will be same as tables in hr DB (hr DB is default DB of Oracle Linux)

- [x] Make sure every listing API can do pagination and sorting

- [x] Make sure employee service use existing hr DB of Oracle XE as dev database

# Task 1 Tips & Sol
- First create folder jdl-config to contain jdl file -> create repos this folder will contain our services code
- Running git init for later keep track file generated by Jhipster and our code

- What is Jhipster Registry → Jhipster Registry is like a dictionary that help service can know some service's metadata such as (IP address, status) which is useful for service communication
- Running services without Jhipster-registry will lead to an error → Make sure you're running Jhipster registry before running services
- To map employee-service with existing oracle database → let modify data source in application-dev.yml (When running with ./mvnw command, Spring Boot will use dev profile this's a reason why we edit on that file)
- Liquibase is a tool will help us to db migration. However in Employee service we'll use existing DB -> no need migration here -> go to application.yml of employee service -> add no-liquibase to dev group
- Default Foreign Key (FK) by Spring Boot will not the same as we defined in DB -> Find FK in Entity Class and update it (Hint: @ManyToOne attribute)

# Task 2 & Sol
- Add Salary Field in entity Job History data + Job tracking
Make sure we can do CRUD operation on a newly created field
Create a custom method to handle tracking job (when helpdesk edits employee's job information, one job history record will be created)
# Task 4 & Sol
- To code FE go to webapp folder
- Edit on navbar.component.html
- Create myapp folder and myapp-routing.module file
